<h1>About the GSAPP Slide and Video Library</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(204 Fayerweather) is a student-run facility providing GSAPP students and faculty with more than 210,000 images in 35mm slide, lantern slide, and digital formats. Our collections seek to provide context to the school&#39;s pedagogical mission across the visual disciplines of architecture, graphic design, and art, as well as related movements in publishing and technology. The slide library has a long history of service to the students and faculty of the Architecture School, and is currently refining and redirecting its resources to provide the best possible assistance in an explosive new world of digital media formats.</p>

<p>The slide library is open to all current GSAPP students on a daily basis and we invite you to visit our facility, borrow materials, and help us design our collection for the future.  The collection grows daily as student staff add new images selected by professors, critics or the student curator. Students, faculty, and friends of the school are encouraged to suggest additional images.</p>
