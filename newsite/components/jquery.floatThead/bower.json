This plugin assumes nothing about your table markup and \"just works\" without losing your events or styles. Supports floating the header while scrolling within the window or while scrolling within a container with overflow. Plays nice with AngularJS and datatables and well written plugins.  \n\n:heart_eyes_cat:**My cat loves it**:heart_eyes_cat:\n\nCheck out the demo / docs page for copious examples:\n\n###[Demos and Docs](http://mkoryak.github.io/floatThead/)  \n\n###[Download](https://github.com/mkoryak/floatThead#download--install)\n```bash\nbower install floatThead\n```\n\n![This is for the really lazy cats](http://giant.gfycat.com/AnyGloriousAlpaca.gif)\n\nFeatures:\n---------\n-   Floats the table header - it remains in viewport as you scroll\n-   Works on tables within a scrollable container or whole window scrolling\n-   Horizontal or vertical scrolling\n-   Doesn't clone the thead - so your events stay bound\n-   Doesn't mess with your styles\n-   Works on any table\n-   Requires no special css\n-   Works with [datatables](http://datatables.net) out of the box\n-   Screen reader support\n-   Plays nicely with angularjs\n\n\nWhat it does not do:\n---------\n-  Does not float the footer\n-  Does not let you lock the first column like in excel\n-  Safari is not fully supported. It might work, or it [might not](https://github.com/mkoryak/floatThead/issues/108), depending on your markup and safari version.  \n\nCommon Pitfalls\n------\nIf you use css and html best practices, this plugin will work. If you are stuck in 1999, you better [read this](http://mkoryak.github.io/floatThead/faq/).\n\nHow to get help with the floatThead\n------------\nAll issues should be reported through github.

None of them support both window and overflow scrolling and many of them depend on special css or require that you set the table column widths. Some of them are good and some of them suck. Go ahead and check them out too. \n\nI have compiled a list here with comments on each one:\n\n\n| Plugin  | Window Scrolling | Overflow-X Scrolling  | Overflow-Y Scrolling | No Special CSS | Keeps Bound Events | Freeze Columns |\n|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|\n| [FloatThead](https://github.com/mkoryak/floatThead/)  | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | no |\n| [Fixed-Table-Header](https://github.com/markmalek/Fixed-Header-Table/) | no | yes | no | yes | no | no |\n| [jquery.scrollTableBody](https://github.com/nheldman/jquery.scrollTableBody) | no | yes | yes | no | ?? | no |\n| [Fixed table rows cols](http://meetselva.github.io/fixed-table-rows-cols) | no | yes | yes | no | ?? | yes |\n| [Table Fixed Header](https://github.com/oma/table-fixed-header) | yes | no | no | yes | no | no | \n| [Sticky Table Header](https://github.com/jmosbech/StickyTableHeaders) | yes | no | no | yes | yes | no | \n| [Grid](https://github.com/mmurph211/Grid) | no | yes | yes | yes | yes | no | \n\n\n [Fixed-Table-Header](https://github.com/markmalek/Fixed-Header-Table/)\nThis is the original. It has been around for ages and it will be the first plugin you find when you start looking. It also has a ton of open unresolved issues. It does not support window scrolling, it does not seem to support y-scrolling withing the container. It loses the events you attached to the thead. Lots of open issues. **Stay away.**\n\n[Fixed table rows cols](http://meetselva.github.io/fixed-table-rows-cols)\nDoes not support window scrolling. Requires you to specify the column widths for the table. This means that the table will not be able to optimally lay itself out. It does support freezing columns in place. If you need that, this might be the plugin for you.\n\n[jquery.scrollTableBody](https://github.com/nheldman/jquery.scrollTableBody)\nDoes not support window scrolling. A newcomer to the scene, not a mature project. Has some major issues with cell padding. **Stay away** until issues are resolved. \n\n[Grid](https://github.com/mmurph211/Grid)\nThis lib is very different from the rest because its main usecase is to give you a sortable grid. You do not run this plugin on an existing table - you need to provide a json or xml data source. This is a great lightweight replacement for datatables. This may be the plugin for you if you are not converting an existing table.\n\n[Table Fixed Header](https://github.com/oma/table-fixed-header)\nThis is a window scrolling plugin, does not support overflow scrolling. Does not work properly when the window is resized and the table width changes. Floated header sticks around if you scroll past table. Author welcomes pull requests but does not fix issues. **Stay away**\n\n[Sticky Table Header](https://github.com/jmosbech/StickyTableHeaders)\nThis is a window scrolling plugin. Does not support overflow scrolling. It is probably the best window scrolling plugin (besides this one). The author seems to fix issues as they arise. \n\n\nLicense\n-------\nMIT\n",
